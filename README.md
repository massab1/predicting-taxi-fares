# Predicting Taxi Gratuities in New York City

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
Built regression and random forest models to predict generous tippers using NYC taxi data. Random forest achieved 86% accuracy and 72% precision. Most important factors: duration, cost, and distance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Understanding
Taxi drivers in NYC struggle to earn livable wages. Predicting high-tipping trips can help optimize service strategies and income potential.

## ðŸ“Š Data Understanding
Data from NYC TLC (2017), ~408,000 trips. Features: fare amount, duration, distance, payment type. Missing and redundant data cleaned.

## ðŸ¤– Modeling & Evaluation
Used scikit-learnâ€™s RandomForestClassifier. Key evaluation metrics: Accuracy (86%), Precision (72%). Visualized top features using feature importance chart.

## âœ… Conclusion
Drivers can identify better routes and service strategies. Future models may include customer tipping history and real-time ride context.
